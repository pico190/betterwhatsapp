# BetterWhatsapp

> A **WhatsApp client for Linux** with theme customization.

> [!NOTE]
> BetterWhatsapp themes **will not work** with the new whatsapp experimental beta theme

## Installation

We're in the process of uploading the **better-whatsapp** package to the Snap Store. In the meantime, you can install it by downloading the .snap file in the releases tab and running:
```sh
snap install <file> --dangerous
```

> [!WARNING]
> Installing BetterWhatsapp this way is **not recommended**, as you won't receive updates.

## Local development
Just as always: `npm i`, `npm run start` for development, `npm run dist` for building...
