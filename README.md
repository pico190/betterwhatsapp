# BetterWhatsapp

> A **WhatsApp client for Linux** with theme customization.

> [!NOTE]
> BetterWhatsapp themes **will not work** with the new whatsapp experimental beta theme

## Installation

We're in the process of uploading the **better-whatsapp** package to the Snap Store. In the meantime, you can install it manually:

- **For Debian-based distributions**, install the `.deb` package.
- **For other distributions**, you can still install it if your Linux distro supports Snap. Download the `.snap` file and run:

  ```sh
  snap install <filename> --dangerous
  ```

> [!WARNING]
> Installing BetterWhatsapp this way is **not recommended**, as you won't receive updates.

## Local development
Just as always: `npm i`, `npm run start` for development, `npm run dist` for building...
